### This repository contains the code and data for the capstone project of Tidal Wetlands Capstone. 

#### Tidal flooding is one of New York Cityâ€™s most dangerous future problems. With decades separating the present and the inevitable flooding, the city has an opportunity to bolster its resiliency infrastructure, which can include hard infrastructure, soft infrastructure, and rezoning for resiliency. Our project evaluates the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of converting vacant lots and bought-out land into  building soft infrastructure (in this case, salt marshes) to diminish the effects of future tidal flooding in New York City. These costs and benefits will be presented through an interactive data visualization tool that our sponsor, the Department of Parks and Recreation, can utilize to inform their future conversion decision processes.
